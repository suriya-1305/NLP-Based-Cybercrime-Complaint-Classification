# NLP-Based-Cybercrime-Complaint-Classification

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) model capable of categorizing complaints based on parameters like the victim, type of fraud, and other relevant criteria. This project emphasizes the entire pipeline, from raw data preparation to the final classification and evaluation of the model.

## Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end NLP solution for classifying unstructured text-based cybercrime complaints into relevant categories and subcategories. The objectives include:

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal to convert raw text into a usable format.
- **Model Development**: Building and evaluating machine learning and NLP models to classify complaints with high accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measuring model effectiveness using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment Readiness**: Delivering a scalable and interpretable solution for real-world use in cybercrime analysis.


## Project Overview

This project addresses the classification of a large, unstructured dataset of cybercrime complaints (~1.56 lakh records) into predefined categories and subcategories. These complaints cover a range of crimes, such as financial fraud, identity theft, and online abuse.

The project involves full control over the data pipeline, starting with **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **feature engineering**, through to **model development** and **performance evaluation**. 

### Key Challenges:
- Cleaning and processing messy text with errors, inconsistencies, and abbreviations.
- Addressing class imbalances across categories and subcategories.
- Ensuring model generalization across diverse datasets.

### Deliverables:
- A complete NLP pipeline for automated complaint classification.
- Saved models and embeddings for reuse and experimentation.
- Insights from exploratory data analysis.
- Detailed model performance reports with metrics and findings.

This repository is structured for ease of use, with clearly organized scripts, notebooks, and resources for reproducibility and further exploration.

### **Assets for Subcategory Classification**
We are performing subcategory classification based on an initial split using the main category. This allows us to classify complaints into more specific subcategories within each main category. To facilitate this, the repository contains three main category folders:

- **category_0**: Women/Child Related Crime
- **category_1**: Financial Fraud Crimes
- **category_2**: Other Cyber Crimes

Inside each category folder, you will find the following assets:
- **Top-performing model weights**: These are the trained models that perform the best for each specific subcategory classification task within the category.
- **Embeddings**: These represent the feature vectors for the text data used in training the models, which are crucial for consistent prediction and model performance.

These assets are stored for reuse and experimentation, ensuring that each model can be applied to relevant complaints for efficient classification.

## Approach

We are performing subcategory classification based on an initial split using the main category. Below are the three main categories:

- **category_0**: Women/Child Related Crime
- **category_1**: Financial Fraud Crimes
- **category_2**: Other Cyber Crimes

### **Labels and their corresponding subcategory group in category 0:**
-	Label 2: Child Pornography/Child Sexual Abuse Material(CSAM)
-	Label 24: Rape/Gang Rape-Sexually Abusive Content
### **Labels and their corresponding subcategory group in category 1:**
-	Label 1: Business Email Compromise/Email Takeover
-	Label 3: Cryptocurrency Fraud
-	Label 8: Debit/Credit Card/Sim Swap Fraud
-	Label 9: Demat/Depository Fraud
-	Label 11: E-Wallet Related Frauds
-	Label 13: Fraud Call/Vishing
